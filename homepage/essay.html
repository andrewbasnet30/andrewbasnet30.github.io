          <h1>My essay</h1>
            <p>I'll be honest, it's probably the weirdest block for anything to be on. Rundown brick buildings with graffiti, used and unused condom packets scattered throughout the concrete, cars and recreational vehicles parked in a single spot for ages, and LIRR trains zooming into the city through the overpass. Construction is being done to replace some of the old buildings that got knocked down over quarantine. The sound of woodcutters and stonecutters edging into different materials throughout the day. And of course, the oh-so-pleasant smell is a mixture of weed and ownerless cats that only seem to get bathed in the rain.  The smells, sights, and sounds of the block just lead to this random, beautiful church building.</p>
            <p>It's noon on a Sunday. Most, if not all of the worship services in the church just ended. You'll see older, first-generation Korean men and women walking from the second-floor main sanctuary down the marble staircase leading into the cafeteria. The second-generation Koreans that finished their worship at 11 am just chilling and hanging out in the cafeteria. Some of them have kids so you'll see the occasional gang of five year olds zooming around the first floor with their little cute baby scooters with flashing lights and colors. One might fall but they get right back up as if nothing happened. It's so weird that kids can do anything and not get hurt. It's almost like they have some sort of speed healing that goes away once you hit fourth grade. Speaking of elementary schoolers, you'll see a couple of these five year olds with their big brother or sister since the parents probably don't want these babies rolling and running around the building by themselves. Then come the middle and high schoolers, speed-walking up from the basement, all loud, complaining about the fact that they’re hungry and how Bible Study went on for far too long, looking like absolute pigs trying to eat as fast as possible. </p>
            <p>Lunchtime is the peak of when everyone gets together. This is when you'll see all the friend groups forming to go out and do something on their own. Usually, the older men and women just sit in the cafeteria and talk about literally anything until they feel like it's time to go. In a room a little further away, down a few steps is a room with a high ceiling, brownish-black bookcases hung on the wall, couches on the left and right of the stairs, and a nice ping pong table in the middle. Usually, you'll see the pastors out of their formal church clothing and in sports attire, sneakers, a dri-fit shirt, and some 90’s looking baggy shorts. At the ping pong table is where everyone feels connected, there are screams and shouts of pain and joy, but everyone is having fun and bonding in a family-like manner. Similarly, a building separate from the church, yet on the property seems to have this effect on teens and children. The GFC, a basketball court filled with children running around trying their best to play basketball on the lowest possible hoop height. They’re breaking all possible rules. But all that matters is that they're having fun. On the other side of the court is where things are a bit more competitive. Middle and high schoolers playing basketball, trash-talking to each other, even getting heated at moments. But as always everyone is having fun because all the winning and losing that happens just brings people together. </p>
            <p>No one thinks of church as something that is fun or interesting just because of the different labels people put on “church”. To me, church is just my new york, it has heavily influenced every aspect of my life, in ways that I can see myself and even subconsciously. </p>
